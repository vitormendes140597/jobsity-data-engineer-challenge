## About the Challenge

### Candidate Considerations

I tried to follow the exactly what the PDF document containing all the requirements was asking for. 

For example, it was asked to create a solution using SQL Databases. By SQL Databases I understand MySQL, Postgres or any other **relational database**.

In addition of that, one of the bonus question **asks to sketch up how I'd do the deploy of my solution in any cloud provider, or how I'd architect it using cloud native platforms.** Even I could do the entiure challenge using ***Platform as a Service*** tools on cloud (it would be a lot easier), I've supposed that the entire challenge should be done using Docker or any similar solution.
